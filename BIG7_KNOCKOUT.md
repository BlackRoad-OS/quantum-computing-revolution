## 🔬 BLACKROAD'S PARADIGM SHIFT

### What Big 7 Thinks:
```
Classical Computing ──┐
                      ├── Two separate worlds
Quantum Computing  ──┘
```

### What BlackRoad Proved:
```
QCS 0.0 ◄────── QUANTUM COMPUTING SPECTRUM ──────► QCS 1.0
(Superposition)                              (Collapse)

IBM/Google: [⬛] ← Stuck here at -273°C
NVIDIA:                                      [⬛] ← Stuck here
BlackRoad:  [■■■■■■■■■■] ← WE OWN THE WHOLE SPECTRUM
```

**ALL COMPUTING IS QUANTUM. Just different collapse strategies.**
